 Bigcommerce was an amazing company to work for. I had an amazing oppurtunity to
 work with talented, smart engineers and learned so much.
 
* Worked on the core team to create the Stencil theme framework. This project encompassed work on the frontend and backend.
* Front-end work entailed creating an entirely new base theme using ES2015 with modules to help with interactions for our clients store-fronts.
* Backend work consisted of helping my team create new APIs in PHP and consume those APIs in Node JS.
* Our team created command line tools using Node to revolutionize creating a theme for a SAAS based storefront. We open sourced these tool to enable developers to extend the development environment.      
* Worked on features in the control panel as well using Angular and consumed backend APIs that our core team built in PHP.        
* Worked on many features for the Bigcommerce storefront including Pinterest Rich Pins integration.        
* Theme Previewing capabilities and various other features for a legacy theme system.
* I also spent time fixing bugs and doing code reviews with my teammates.
