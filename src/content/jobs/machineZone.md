Working on the [Satori Live data](https://satori.com) platform web team. Using React, React Native, and Redux we created a free and open data platform that enables individuals to share their data with the rest of the world. We also used Craft CMS to manage marketing, docs, demos, and SDKs.

* Helped create a React application that allows users to browse open data channels, created the console to enable users to browse the data.
* Created real-time collaboration tools powered by our efficient web-socket implementation. 
* Created many re-usable modular components that are currently distributed using NPM to our various applications.
* Led the team for our demo application reveal. This included creating, deploying applications showcasing the benefits of our platform, 
  while keeping it simple enough for new developers to start developing on Satori. These applications were also made open source to help anyone get started.
* Built React and React Native components with Google maps API as well, using coordinates, bounds to show real-time assets and drawing complex poly-lines.
* Created real time visuals and charts using d3.js for various projects.
