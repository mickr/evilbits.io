I worked on the application infrastructure team at Visa. We were responsible for all application wide libraries, builds, environments, and deployments. I managed all builds and environments, and build environments and built custom software to assist in deployments and verification of successful builds.

* Created a Rails based application to help track, verify, and deploy code to a multitude of environments.
* Lead the effort to convert all our teams and SVN code over to Git for version control.
* I actively trained 100+ engineers on how to use git in production.
* Created daily briefings to help developers understand and manage their code with git.
* Lead the effort of migrating our Jenkins build system to also include Bamboo for continuous integration of our Java code to Artifactory.
* I worked closely to with stakeholders to create coverage reports, static security scans, and deployment of code.
* Managed our multi-node Jenkins build system for 10+ teams of developers. This system built a multitude of code from Java code using Maven, Rails, and JS SPAs.
* Extensive experience using Maven to build and configure Java applications and deploy that code to Tomcat application servers.
* Created deployment tools in various languages and built tools for monitoring those deployments.
